# hello-world

Hello Everyone,

My name is Jorel and I've been a SQL, .NET and web developer since 2011 and it has pretty much taken over my whole life. Before this I was an auto technician with Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep and a Program Representative with the Bureau of Automotive Repair in the State of California. I still work at the Bureau of Automotive Repair but as a full time full-stack developer. I hope to continue to add to my GitHub account to act as part of my portfolio due to the fact that most of my projects are internal and cannot be shared or exposed to the public. I also would like to give back to the open source community as I have benefited from this community in almost everything I've done.
